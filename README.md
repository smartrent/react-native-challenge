# SmartRent React Native Engineering Challenge

## Welcome

First of all, welcome to our React Native engineering challenge!

If you've made it this far, we are already interested in you. This challenge is not meant to trip you up, it's
designed for us to better learn where your technical skills lie and understand how you solve problems that might
come up in a day-to-day real world application.

We sent you this repository early so that you have the opportunity to get the project building on your own.

### Setup

You will need these tools installed for the project to build:

**[nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.x**

**[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)**

**xcode or Android Studio (feel free to use either)**

1. Clone this repository

2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies

3. Start the app with `yarn ios` or `yarn android`.

Please build the app on a simulator or emulator, or prepare some way to screen share your physical device during the interview.

If everything works, you should see this welcome screen:

### Troubleshooting

This project is bootstrapped with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/), so check out their "getting started" guide if you run into any unexpected behavior.

### Typescript

If you would like to [convert the app to TypeScript](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript), feel free to do so.
